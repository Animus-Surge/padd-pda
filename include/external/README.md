## About the external folder

The `/include/external` folder is intended for single-header libraries for systems that are not rewritten from scratch, or for systems that will
eventually be rewritten at a later date and for now will have a header file imported.

### Current externals

- HTTPRequest (`./HTTPRequest.hpp`) - https://github.com/elnormous/HTTPRequest
